# Toolbox
**Keep Your Online Resources Organzied**


## User Narratives

- As a student with mediocre organization skills and a proclivity for too many tabs, Toolbox helps me keep track of my online resources in an intuitive, visually stimulating way. When I open my “college toolbox”, I can easily access relevant subsections like tuition, sports, or clown club. Each subsection houses an array of online “tools” such as useful links, contact info, forms, calendars, etc.

- As a blossoming librarian who harbors resentment against online bookmarks, I needed a better way to keep track of all the material I discover when I delve down questionable internet rabbit holes each evening. My current toolboxes, which include the origin of gouache and the mating rituals of the Pacific Bonito, are filled with excellent research that I often reference.
